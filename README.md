# thermomoduino
ThermoMoDuino is a replacement module for the single level thermostats used in small shop and industry type cooling devices for Engravers, Laser-Cutters, CNC-Machines and many more.  
It utilizes optimized algorithms to detect and quickly respond to temperature changes in the cooling media. It furthermore extends the cooling cycle dynamicly using the heat pumps bypass valve (if present).  

This repo contains the arduino code and the STL files to build a simple thermostat module using an Arduino Nano as a controller.
